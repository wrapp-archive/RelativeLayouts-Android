RelativeLayouts
===============

Relative layouts is a simple library that makes it easier to create relative layouts in Android.

Usage
=====

Create a builder for a certain view and apply the wanted properties.

```java
    TextView actionTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.TimelineActionTextView);
    ImageView actionViewBubble = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.TimelineActionBubble);
    RelativeLayouts.Builder builder;

    if (rightAlign) {
      builder = new Builder(actionViewBubble, true, true);
      builder.alignParentBottom().alignParentLeft().apply();

      builder = new Builder(actionTextView, true, true);
      builder.alignParentBottom().rightOf(actionViewBubble).apply();
    }else{
      builder = new Builder(actionViewBubble, true, true);
      builder.alignParentBottom().alignParentRight().apply();

      builder = new Builder(actionTextView, true, true);
      builder.alignParentBottom().leftOf(actionViewBubble).apply();
    }
```

Or create a builder and apply properties on one line:

```java
    TextView actionTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.TimelineActionTextView);

    new Builder(actionTextView, true, true).alignParentTop().alignParentRight().apply();
```
